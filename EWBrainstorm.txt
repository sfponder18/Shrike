What emitters are present?

How are they changing over time?

Where (roughly) are they strongest?

Are they affecting my systems or just “background RF”?

2) Emitter characterization over raw power

Raw RSSI/energy is useful, but ES becomes valuable when you can output:

center frequency, bandwidth

duty cycle / burst structure

frequency agility / hopping indicators

modulation “family” confidence (even coarse)

stability over time (new vs persistent)

Even if classification is imperfect, consistent descriptors are gold.

3) ES drives EP decisions with evidence

EP shouldn’t just say “GPS bad” or “link bad.”
It should be able to say:

“I’m seeing wideband noise near my control band”

“Interference is narrowband and persistent at X”

“GNSS shows AGC rise + C/N0 drop consistent with denial”

“Nav inconsistency with RF calm suggests spoofing-like symptoms”
(Still symptom-based, but much more informative.)

A) Wideband scanning + “detected emitter list”

Core ES product: a rolling table like:

timestamp (and optionally lat/long/alt if available)

frequency, bandwidth

power proxy

duty cycle

persistence score (new/recurring)

confidence score

This becomes your “radar picture” of RF.

B) Event-driven “zoom & record”

Run the sweep until something trips a trigger:

energy threshold

sudden change

match to known preamble/features (optional)

unusual duty cycle patterns

Then:

dwell longer on that band

capture higher-resolution I/Q or high-res PSD

save a clip for later analysis/training
C) Trend and anomaly detection

ES is most useful when it tells you:

“something changed”
not just “here’s the spectrum.”

Useful anomalies:

New carrier appeared

Band occupancy jumped

Burst rate increased

Broadband noise floor rose

D) Highly accurate direction finding (DF) 

 With multi-channel/multi-antenna/multi-aircraft, DF is the next leap:

phase interferometry / TDOA-type methods (system-level)

even coarse bearing helps correlate “this emitter” to geography

But don’t start here unless you need it—get the emitter list + event capture right first.

Treat receive time as a resource:

Guard channels (control + GNSS) get guaranteed dwell

Sweep gets the remaining budget

Events preempt sweep but not guard

2) Design the RF front end for measurement fidelity

ES lives or dies on dynamic range and repeatability:

switchable preselectors (avoid overload)

LNA with bypass (avoid compression)

stable reference clock (frequency accuracy)

known gain states (so your “power proxy” is comparable over time)

3) Logging format matters (so ES becomes reusable data)

Log so you can build:

RF maps

training datasets

post-mission playback

Practical outputs:

emitter list (CSV/JSON)

event clips (short I/Q captures or high-res PSD)

summary spectrograms (compressed)

ES ↔ EP bridge (how ES feeds protection)

If ES is 50%, EP becomes less “failsafe-y” and more informed:

If ES sees interference centered on your link band → EP can recommend channel change, profile switch, or autonomy bias

If ES sees RF calm but GNSS gets weird → EP treats nav as suspect (spoof-like symptoms) and gates GPS-dependent behaviors

If ES sees a step rise in noise floor across bands → EP expects wider comms degradation and shifts mission plan accordingly
